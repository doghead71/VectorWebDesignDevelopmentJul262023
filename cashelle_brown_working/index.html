        <p> 
            <img src="images/test7.jpg" height="200" width="200">My name is Cashelle Eunique Brown, a 27 year old Personal Trainer residing in St.Catherine. <br />
        I offer tailored work out packages for any age client.
         It's never too late or early to get fit and healthy.
         <br />In the past I struggled with my weight, this insecurity led me to creating a plan. <br />
        This plan resulted in me losing over 40lbs on my own. The confidence and joy this achievement, 
        <br />brought me is an experience I want everyone to have, we all deserve to feel confortable in our own skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            While personal training is my passion next to the I.T field. I'm also a Customer Service Representative for Ebay.<br />
            In the past I've worked for the largest publicly traded Internet domain registrar and web hosting company,
            <br />GoDaddy for over a year. This was definitely a stepping stone to increasing my interest in Web Design on a whole.
            <br />Due to the various web designers I would interact with on the daily.     </p>
