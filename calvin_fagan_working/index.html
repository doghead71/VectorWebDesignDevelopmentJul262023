        <h1>About Goku</h1>
        <p>
            Goku, born Kakarot, is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the overall main protagonist of the 
            Dragon Ball series. He is Bardock and Gine's youngest son, the husband of Chi-Chi, 
            and the father of Gohan and Goten.
        </p>

        <p>
            Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, 
            Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. 
            A head injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, 
            ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to 
            become one of Earth's greatest defenders.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Goku constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, 
            which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple times.
        </p>
