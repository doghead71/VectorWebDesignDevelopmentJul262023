        <h1>Abount Goku</h1>
        <p>
            Goku born Kakarot, is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the overall main protagonist of the 
            Dragon Ball series. He is Bardock and Gine's youngest son, the husband of Chi-Chi, 
            and the father of Gohan and Goten.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, 
            Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. 
            A head injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, 
            ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to 
            become one of Earth's greatest defenders. Goku constantly strives and trains 
            to be the greatest warrior possible, 
            which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple times.
        </p>
