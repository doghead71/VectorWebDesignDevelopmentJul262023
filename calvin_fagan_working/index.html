<h1>About Goku</h1>
<p>
Goku, born Kakarot, is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the overall main protagonist of the 
Dragon Ball series. He is Bardock and Gine's youngest son, the husband of Chi-Chi, 
and the father of Gohan and Goten.
</p>

<p>
Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, 
Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. 
A head injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, 
ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to 
become one of Earth's greatest defenders.
</p>
<p>
Goku constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, 
which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple times.
