          <h3>Lawn Mowing</h3>
          <p>
            A well-mowed lawn makes the yard look neat. Various mowers will be brought in and set up to meet the client’s needs based on the grass type. As we mow the grass at specific heights, they consider all variables. Hedging and spring trimming are often combined with lawn mowing.

            <h3>Trimming</h3>
            <p>
              Having overgrown trees and hedges can make the outdoor space look messy and difficult to use. By cutting back the overgrown areas, CF Landscaping can make the space more appealing and encourage the client to spend more time there.

            <h3>Hedging</h3>
            <p>
              The act of hedging is the practice of trimming down plants 
              into geometrical shapes. This makes the yard of an owner of 
              a landscape attractive and gives the yard an appealing look. 
              CF Landscaping possess well-organized hedging skills and the 
              right landscaping tools.

            <h3>Leaf Removal</h3>
            <p>
              Fall and spring are the seasons when leaves are most likely 
              to fall to the ground. Giving lawn maintenance services such 
              as leaf removal regularly, whether raking or blowing, is possible.

            <p>
              A pruning process refers to cutting off dead leaves from a plant 
              after they have decayed and turned brown. Pruning and trimming are 
              challenging tasks that need to be carried out at the appropriate 
              time of year, based on the type of plants to be pruned.</p>
