    <p>I'm Alaine Williams. Hello. As an IT student currently employed in the finance sector.</p>
</div>
    <p>
        The physical side of information technology has always drawn me in. My father enjoyed creating personal computers from scratch, and a close friend of mine insisted on driving me to job sites so I could observe a data network technician in action. It seemed certain that much earlier than now, I would be swiveling network connections or carefully handling hard drives. But I struggled to finish my accounting courses for a significant portion of my adult life.
I consciously and sincerely decided to pursue my goal of working in information technology in 2018. 

I decided to pursue my studies at Vector Technology Institute because I thought the environment there was ideal for both my personality and my skill level, or lack thereof. You may trust me when I say that the choice was the greatest and that I am enjoying every second—or should I say, every module—of it.
