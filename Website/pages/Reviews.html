                <p>I'm more than happy to recommend RJR Events, Decor & Rental Services. I came into contact
                    with the owner of this company about 5 years ago and was immediately impressed by her
                    craftsmanship and events planning mechanism. I then realised that she had this company and oh how it
                    made my life
                    less painful when planning my events. Ever since I've been using her service, as it is second to
                    none
                    that I've come across. Thanks RJR Events, Decor & Rental!</p>

                <P>Recently collaborated with RJR Events Decor & Rentals and it was a breathe of fresh air.
                    What I appreciated about them the most was that they spent the time getting to know our
                    company so they were able to recommend changes we weren't even thinking about. The team
                    was also extremely responsive to all our changes, and as a result had our event planning
                    finalized ahead of schedule. I would highly recommend this team.</P>

                <p> Miss McFarlane and her team are extremely professional. I work with Miss Mac on a
                    regular basis in planning my events and her customers get outstanding service. She is
                    one of the top experts in Events PLanning. She is someone who you trust, and her team
                    will exceed your expectations. I highly recommend RJR Events Decor & Rentals.</p>
